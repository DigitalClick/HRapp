                                    Corporate culture does not mean all employees are like-minded. It is not only how employees feel and operate while in the workplace, but how personalities are allowed to intermix in an organization to allow a cohesive and cooperative effort on projects. The feeling of working as a team, with similar goals and cohesive personality types, allows for cooperation.
